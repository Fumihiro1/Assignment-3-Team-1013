<h1>Online Learning: The impacts of staying virtual.</h1>

<p>Online learning is an education type that takes place on the internet, and it is a form of long distance learning.</p>

<p>The reason weâ€™ve chosen Online Learning as our topic is because online learning is important to us in daily life, especially after the pandemic occurred.</p>
    
<p> We've been using online learning to communicate and learn for the past two years. Online learning was and will be an important part of our life.</p>

<p>Researching through the various topics provided for us from the Baeker 2019 book in the course resources, we felt it would be of our best interest</p> 

<p>to start researching on the various impacts online learning has on us.</p>
