<h1>Online Learning: The impacts of staying virtual.</h1>
<h5>Due Date: 12/06/2022 - Calender Week 12</h5>
<h5>Chosen Topic: Online Learning</h5>

<p>The topic we chose to investigate in our extensive research is Online Learning. Online learning is a form 
  <br>
  of virtual study where students are taught via online sources such as Canvas and Zoom. One of the
  <br>
  main reasons why Online Learning has been a global interest for a few years now is due to the global
  <br>
  pandemic which started occuring during the first few months of 2020, known as Covid-19. This 
  <br>
  effectively put many students and teachers into a lockdown state, where only bare essentials were 
  <br>
  able to be open like a supermarket or a pharmacy, to stop the spread of the virus. This meant that students 
  <br>
  needed a new form of education to partake in during the various lockdowns the globe has encountered, 
  <br>
  which raised the attention to Online / Virtual Learning.
