<h1>Choices in Online Learning</h1>
<p>
    Asynchronous Online Courses t
    These types of courses are not available in real time. Students are given content and assignments, as well as a deadline for completing course work and exams. Discussion boards, blogs, and wikis are common places for people to interact. As a result, there will be no class time. Students with time constraints or hectic schedules benefit from asynchronous online learning settings.
</p>
<p>
    Synchrony Online Courses 
    These types of courses necessitate simultaneous online interaction between the instructor and all enrolled students. Participants interact through text, video, or audio chat, which is similar to a webinar in several aspects. Synchronous learning environments allow students to take part in a course in real time from a distance.
</p>
<p>Hybrid Courses
    Often known as blended courses, are learning settings that allow students to interact both in person and online. Hybrid classes typically meet in person many times throughout the semester and allow for computer¨Cbased communication in between those sessions.</p>
