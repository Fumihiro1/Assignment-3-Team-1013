    <h1>Choices schools have taken, high level learning</h1>

    <p>Online learning has taken many different forms over its history so schools and universities had a plethora of online learning formats to choose from that will better fit their way of teaching. One such format is blended learning which is a combination of online learning and in-person learning, this format gives the student more freedom around their timetable and does not limit learning hours to just the time spent in class with their teachers and fellow students. Blended learning was implemented by some courses even at AUT, the beginning of 2022 was affected by covid-19 restriction which limited the number of students allowed in the classroom at one time. Blended learning had classes that had a larger student population go online for their lectures but once the restrictions allow a large number in the classroom lab tutorials began with smaller groups in that class. Another format is fully online learning where there is no in-person learning in the classroom most schools and universities used this form at the beginning of the covid-19 lockdowns due to the heavy restrictions placed on them during these times. </p>
    <p>Many schools were not initially prepared for fully online learning and lacked the equipment and knowledge on how to conduct their selves during this time and so were students. Many schools and universities needed to loan out equipment such as laptops and Chromebooks to their students that didnt have access to such devices. The choice that the school needed to take is whether loan out these devices with the risk of them not coming back or coming back damaged in some form or another.</p>
    <p>Schools and universities have also chosen to implement more robust mental health and well-being criteria in their schools to safeguard their students during the changes that happen when transitioning from fully in-person learning to fully online learning. Schools and universities that have implemented this more robust mental health and well-being criteria did this by monitoring students attendance and engagement with the class and assigned work. In many of the lower levels of learning such as primary and secondary schools teachers would engage with the students caregivers/parents to gauge any concerns they are feeling towards the learning of the student.</p>
    <p>Choices that were made by the schools and universities were whether to still follow the classroom structure such as the class is at this time and attendants are required for all students. This type of framework may work, or it might hinder the studentâ€™s ability to learn but that is the choice of the school or university. Many choose the more flexible learning to where you were able to learn and do the classwork at the times it suited you like the students, but this way of learning does require a large amount of time management which some students may have but some may not.</p>
    <p>Many schools and universities are now planning for the future with online learning in mind and having it become a more viable and reliable alternative to in-person learning. This would allow a larger number of students to attend this class and not be limited to the number that can fit in the physical classroom at one time. Over the past 20 years, online learning has been slowly integrating into the schooling field with the interdiction of computers and the internet but since the covid-19 pandemic lockdowns that integration was drastically accelerated due to the need of staying home and away from other people such as fellow students and teachers. That is why the choices schools and universities have taken towards online learning in the past couple of years have grown so drastically.</p>
