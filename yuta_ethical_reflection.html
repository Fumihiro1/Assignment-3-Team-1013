    Through an extensive research on the online learning topic, I have come to the conclusion that online learning is something I would
    like to see more researched, and improved. The benefits of online learning from my own little research was that many people felt like
    myself felt that the class schedules we had were more accesible, as some classes started at 8am in the morning, meaning for those living
    afar from campus needed to commute to campus extremely early. Another one of the reasons why I felt that online learning should be
    practiced and understood more is because online learning can provide students with a more flexible time schedule. What I really enjoyed
    about AUT's take on the timetable choices is that they allowed for students to choose their own classes via the Arion website. Although there
    were preset timetables with no clashes available, I found that being able to choose my own timetable and hours were an extremely beneficial
    factor for me, as I prefer an early morning schedule with more free time towards the afternoon. Being able to choose my own timetable allowed 
    me to have most of my classes before 6pm, meaning that after eating dinner I had plenty of time for myself to study independently, or play a few
    of my favourite games to take a mental break from all the schoolwork I needed to manange.

    Although I enjoyed online learning immensely, there were a few downsides I found throughout the 12 or so weeks of learning I had in Semester 1
    at AUT. One of the biggest downsides I really disliked was the lack of face to face communication opportunities, and the overall quality of 
    education I believe being a little dull. Although I found myself liking the canvas and teams integration to AUT papers so we could as for any help
    regarding our assignments, I still do believe that nothing is better than being able to ask questions regarding any topics to an experienced
    lecturer or a professor directly, rather than spending time waiting for email replies. I felt like going back to campus and being able to ask for help
    immediately was very efficient, as the constructive feedback I was able to gain from campus was easier to interpret into my various prijects and 
    assignmentd. I did however feel a little more tired and worn out while partaking in the online learning implementation during the first few weeks
    of Semester 1. This is most likely due to the extra screen time that I needed to go through in order to attend my online lectures, but also work on 
    any assessemnts so I can pass my papers. I felt a little more drawn out of energy, as sitting on a chair and desk by a computer for a majority of my day
    was not enjoyable. However, I was able to manage my screen time and still get a decent bit of exercise throughout the lockdown stages, so I do not have
    any complaints regarding online learning overall.

    I think online learning overall is a great pactice. Throughout the 12 weeks of learning on and off online and onsite at AUT's first semester, I felt that
    the quality of my learning experiences were excellent to say the least. I think that Iw as able to gain great knowledge from the various, online lectures
    I scheduled myself in, and apply them straight into the assignments I was tasked to. I think that the face to face communications through the last few weeks 
    of the semester were extremely valuable, online learning's practices at AUT was very enjoyable. Being able to create my own schedule to fit my needs at the start
    of this year meant that I was able to focus more work such as tutorials near Tues - Thursday, and have more time for independent study during Monday and 
    Friday. This was excellent as I felt that I was able to succeed through semester 1 with satisfactory grades. I think online learning should be more researched,
    thought of and understood by scientists to discover more issues with the virtual state of education. There are many benefits and downsides as well which even related
    to psycological problems such as mental illnesses (depression, anxiety) developing on some students, which is definitely something that should be looked into by
    schools so they can possibly resude the amount of external stress that could occur during online learning. However, I feel that I am quite satisfied with
    the state of online learning especially at AUT, as those who teach and tutor are very knowledged and proffessional, leading up to an extremely enjoyable
    few weeks of the first semester here.
