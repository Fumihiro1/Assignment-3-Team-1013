<h1>The Risks of Online Learning</h1>

<p>Although Online Learning seems like a very practical take into education for the future with mny benefits and advantages,
    it still has its downsides that can potentially hinder a student's experience in learning. Obviously, each student is different. and
    their attention spans and learning ethics will differ aswwell. There were many students who preferred online learning even after
    the pandemic restrictions were taken off, and still those who preferred to go back into campus for a more regulated study environment.
</p>

<p>One of the biggest downsides to online learning is the inability for most students to maintain their focus on their screens for extended
    periods of time. Most students find that maintaining a high level of focus to keep studying a challenge, as for one, there is a greater chance
    for students to find themselves flicking on their phones every few minutes or simply being distracted by social media on their computers. Many 
    online learning classes could start to find their limits and lose their fun aspect, an there are also limitations to how much you can do in an online
    environment. So this ties up to the teachers finding new ways to innovate their classes and keep the students engaged by keeping their classes very 
    interactive, so students are not finding themselves sitting at their computer only listening.
</p>

<p>Online learning has a negative psycological effects on students due to the extended period of isolation and being alone while being educated.
    The minimal physical interactions and face to face conversations mean that many students will lack the opportunities to be able to partake in
    group assignments
