<h1>The Risks of Online Learning</h1>

<p>Although Online Learning seems like a very practical take into education for the future with mny benefits and advantages,
    it still has its downsides that can potentially hinder a student's experience in learning. Obviously, each student is different. and
    their attention spans and learning ethics will differ aswwell. There were many students who preferred online learning even after
    the pandemic restrictions were taken off, and still those who preferred to go back into campus for a more regulated study environment.
</p>

<p>One of the biggest downsides to online learning is the inability for most students to maintain their focus on their screens for extended
    periods of time. Most students find that maintaining a high level of focus to keep studying a challenge, as for one, there is a greater chance
    for students to find themselves flicking on their phones every few minutes or simply being distracted by social media on their computers. Many 
    online learning classes could start to find their limits and lose their fun aspect, an there are also limitations to how much you can do in an online
    environment. So this ties up to the teachers finding new ways to innovate their classes and keep the students engaged by keeping their classes very 
    interactive, so students are not finding themselves sitting at their computer only listening. Keeping screen time controlled and also managing
    school work can be a quite heavy load on students depending on the amount of class hours students may get. Especially if the student is learning
    at a high level as such in universities for example, it can be difficult to manage the amount of screen time they dedicate to their school work 
    but also keeping themselves off their computer to exercise or take a break. The increase in screen time due to online learning has been a large concern
    for many parents of affected students, as it can cause development of bad computer habits and even physical problems like posture, which can affected
    students in the future.
</p>

<p>Online learning has a negative psycological effects on students due to the extended period of isolation and being alone while being educated.
    The minimal physical interactions and face to face conversations mean that many students will lack the opportunities to be able to partake in
    group assignments with the added benefits of face to face. Although many schools have offered the ability to partake in different classes and lessons
    that they were scheduled as online on platforms such as Canvas and Zoom, the lack of face to face communication opportunities with a professor or a tutor
    is seen as a huge disadvantage to online learning. While being in zoom calls can solve the issue of not having the constructive feedback they could gain
    from being in campus, the lack of overall physical interaction between students and peers being lowered means that the amount of interactions online learning
    should have should be theoretically higher, since physical interactions and the connections you build with experienced professors and such are very 
    important.
</p>

<p>One of the more obvious reasons why not having the physical interactions and face to face communications are the development of early depression, anxiety
    or different levels of stress for many young students. According to a study posted to an online resource in 2021 by Frontier Psychiatry, out of the 4115 
    participants in a research on the effect of online learning, depression, anxiety and stress were the main effect on students, during the 2019-2022 pandemic.
    Around 31.9% of students found themselves to be depressed during the pandemic while online learning, with different sources such as the time they spend
    studying, the different relationships they have with parents and the student's own satisfaction with the work they were able to achieve during lockdown.
    About 32.9% of the students found that they experienced different levels of anxiety, which was also sourced by various reasons similar to those that was
    causing the early stages of depression. 14.6% of students found themselves to be stressed during the pademic, which is quite fair as one of the main reasons
    many students found themselves stressed over was grades and more similar reasonings as such with depression and anxiety. Through this study for example, it is 
    understood that the overall negative causes of online learning should be causing concerns for many, as students are at risk of developing mental illnesses
    due to the added stress of online learning, and other physical damages they could face while learning online during the pandemic.
