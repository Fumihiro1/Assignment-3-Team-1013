Although traditional onsite learning has its obvious benefits, it may not be sustainable in the future. Online learning can still provide good quality learning, and with the large population of students siding towards the virtual learning environments, developers all around the world will have their hands tied to creating great learning applications.</p>
<p>Students will no doubt be exposed many opportunities as well moving forward with the topic of online learning. According to ccaurora.com, the time flexibility online learning can offer means that students do not need to be tied to a traditional 7am – 3pm time schedule, which "most" schools tend to have.
