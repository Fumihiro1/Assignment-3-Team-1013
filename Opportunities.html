<h1>Opportunities with the online learning topic.
</h1>

<p>There were many opportunities in the said topic regarding online learning. One of them is the future of learning moving forward. Although traditional onsite learning has its obvious benefits, it may not be sustainable in the future. Online learning can still provide good quality learning, and with the large population of students siding towards the virtual learning environments, developers all around the world will have their hands tied to creating great learning applications.</p>
<p>Students will no doubt be exposed many opportunities as well moving forward with the topic of online learning. According to ccaurora.com, the time flexibility online learning can offer means that students do not need to be tied to a traditional 7am – 3pm time schedule, which "most" schools tend to have. There can be more suitable resource / assignment due dates as well, considering that the resources and assignments do not need to be handed in via a hard copy, it can make it easier for material to be gathered from students. ​</p>
<p>Online learning provides a more efficient way for teachers to deliver lectures, online learning can be delivered in multiple ways such as, video, word doc, pdf or live videos. It will also save the time for teachers and students on the road, teachers can deliver lessons at home and students can attend lectures anywhere else instead of being restricted by geographical boundaries.</p>
<p>Online learning reduces financial cost for students and the teachers, it is far more affordable than attending lectures, especially to those who live in rural areas, other than waking up before the sun does, transportation fee is a headache. This will decrease the rate students miss out the lesson, the attendance overall has been improved.</p>
<p>When viewing the importance of online learning, the flexible learning hour is a big factor. Online learning offers students a chance to learn whenever the location or time suits them. Considering different learning habits each student has, the traditional class forces students to keep on the pace of the class, otherwise they will be left behind, online learning leaves students more space to and more freedom to study at their own space. </p>
<p>Some students see eLearning as an advantage in terms of planning and adaptability. In some projects, people searching for a degree or a declaration can begin taking courses right away. Depending on the circumstances, learners can take a 16-week course or a shortened eight-week course. In a later section, we will discuss the benefits of accelerated courses.</p>
<p>Some online courses require students to work with peers on set dates or meet with an educator during the virtual available time, despite the fact that numerous online courses run no concurrently to offer the greatest booking flexibility. In order to take an online course successfully, learners should explore these needs.</p>
<p>Since students are not bound to a fixed schedule, they can shuffle their vocations and school. Traditional study halls have set meeting times, which the students cannot alter, forcing them to plan their schedules around these dates. A majority of people who choose internet learning have a variety of responsibilities, and prefer this method of learning because it gives them more control over how they allocate their time. </p>
<p>
    Face-to-face learning lacks autonomy and flexibility, whereas web-based learning enables students to participate in the class at a time that is convenient for them. The student may also fall behind in the online course as a result of lingering. Gaining great habits takes some investment, but you will be fulfilled by being effective and achieving your goals.</p>
<p>Ability to time-the-board systematically doesn't just happen. This has to be learned. If you master it, it will benefit you forever. It may be a challenge for an online learner to devote sufficient time to courses in which they may not be able to meet simultaneously online or face to face. By scheduling class time ahead of time, most learners were able to ensure that class cooperation would take place during the scheduled class time.</p>
