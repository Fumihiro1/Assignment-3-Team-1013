        School has been difficult. For me, the most difficult issue this year has been transitioning to 100% online schooling. As a student, I'd say I've usually completed all of my assignments for all of my classes. The most significant shift I've noticed in myself is that I'm getting less focused on my schoolwork.

        Learning in a physical classroom differs significantly from learning online. In a classroom, the majority of your attention is concentrated there; but, unlike virtually, the temptations are real! Yes, self-discipline is beneficial to learning, but with so much thrown at you, you can't blame the learner for not wanting to work... at least in my perspective.

        This online learning has had a personal impact on me because I found myself turning in homework weeks late throughout this time. It wasn't that I couldn't do them; it was that I lacked the passion and energy to do them. This isn't something I'm used to. I felt disoriented without a set timetable. That makes me seem like a robot, but I guess it's because it's been like this since we were children, and a significant change like this affects me the most.

        As a result, I've decided that online learning is not for me in the future! Maybe for one or two subjects, but I intend to spend the most of my school days in a physical classroom.Despite the fact that this has been a difficult moment at school and in the real world, remembering to stand tall will help us get through it together.

        As a student, my online learning experience has been satisfactory. I sometimes feel that I'm not interested in doing my homework and that I'm a slacker. I still complete the tasks, but I occasionally submit them late. It's as if I'll complete the homework anytime I want.

        There is a reason for this, and it is because that is where I am completing my schoolwork. My home is not a learning setting like a school, where there are teachers, other students, learning equipment, desks/tables, seats, a library, plenty of room, and people to help you. At home, it's as if you're napping or resting.In a classroom, I am able to concentrate more on my assignments/work and get more interested in the subject. When I'm in a classroom, I feel ready to learn and get my brain going; at home, I find it difficult to stay focused since I'm always distracted. My professors and students are always willing to help me when I need it. I have to wait for an answer when I have a question at home.I must admit that I am always nervous in class when I am in school. I'm not nervous now that I'm studying at home. Because a classroom is a learning environment in a school, I would not select more online studying in the future based on my current online learning experience. In addition, I believe it is easier to communicate with my classmates/groups, teachers, counsellors, and principal for projects. For me, going to school is the best option.
