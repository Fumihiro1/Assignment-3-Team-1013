        People have different habits, some students found out it is easier and more efficient to study in front of computers. However, some are not, some students found out they have difficulties focusing on the screen for a long period while studying at home. They have a greater chance of being distracted by social media or games.

        Another key challenge is internet connection. Students who live in small cities or towns are still facing internet connectivity issues. Without a consistent internet connection, there will be a lack of learning for the students.

        In traditional classes, if students have any issue teachers are able to give face to face immediate feedback. However, through online teachers cannot provide immediate help to students in the first place when they are facing an issue.
