        School has been difficult. For me, the most difficult issue this year has been transitioning to 100% online schooling. As a student, I'd say I've usually completed all of my assignments for all of my classes. The most significant shift I've noticed in myself is that I'm getting less focused on my schoolwork.

        Learning in a physical classroom differs significantly from learning online. In a classroom, the majority of your attention is concentrated there; but, unlike virtually, the temptations are real! Yes, self-discipline is beneficial to learning, but with so much thrown at you, you can't blame the learner for not wanting to work... at least in my perspective.

        This online learning has had a personal impact on me because I found myself turning in homework weeks late throughout this time. It wasn't that I couldn't do them; it was that I lacked the passion and energy to do them. This isn't something I'm used to. I felt disoriented without a set timetable. That makes me seem like a robot, but I guess it's because it's been like this since we were children, and a significant change like this affects me the most.

        As a result, I've decided that online learning is not for me in the future! Maybe for one or two subjects, but I intend to spend the most of my school days in a physical classroom.Despite the fact that this has been a difficult moment at school and in the real world, remembering to stand tall will help us get through it together.

        I think online learning overall is a great pactice. Throughout the 12 weeks of learning on and off online and onsite at AUT's first semester, I felt that
        the quality of my learning experiences were excellent to say the least. I think that Iw as able to gain great knowledge from the various, online lectures
        I scheduled myself in, and apply them straight into the assignments I was tasked to. I think that the face to face communications through the last few weeks
        of the semester were extremely valuable, online learning's practices at AUT was very enjoyable. Being able to create my own schedule to fit my needs at the start
        of this year meant that I was able to focus more work such as tutorials near Tues - Thursday, and have more time for independent study during Monday and
        Friday. This was excellent as I felt that I was able to succeed through semester 1 with satisfactory grades. I think online learning should be more researched,
        thought of and understood by scientists to discover more issues with the virtual state of education. There are many benefits and downsides as well which even related
        to psycological problems such as mental illnesses (depression, anxiety) developing on some students, which is definitely something that should be looked into by
        schools so they can possibly resude the amount of external stress that could occur during online learning. However, I feel that I am quite satisfied with
        the state of online learning especially at AUT, as those who teach and tutor are very knowledged and proffessional, leading up to an extremely enjoyable
        few weeks of the first semester here.
