    <h1>The different topics we researched...</h1>

    <p>As shown in the homepage tab, our main focus for this research based assignment is to
    research and develop a better understanding on how online learning can affect us students
    in different ways. The main sub-categories for this which were obvious to us were the advantages
    online learning. How it can affect us positively and the different ways it can help us learn.</p>

    <p>We will also research on the disadvantages of online learning, which can be disadvantages directly 
    related to but not limited to the quality of learning students are able to get, the concerns<br> 
    of mental stress online learning may cause to students. </p>

     <p>Online Learning is a form of learning that takes place virtually on platforms such as Canvas and Zoom, allowing students to continue learning while being affected 
    by the pandemic, staying at home. These practices according to the Baeker 2019 book has been done even as early as 1973, with message bords that connected people together.â€‹
    The demand for online learning has been proven to be quite high, as even post-pandemic where onsite learning has been resumed, 73 percent of students still prefer courses 
    to be delivered online. A hybrid of both were also preferred by many, which equated to around 68  percent of students surveyed according to an online resource.

    <p>Another topic we were also interested in was the different choices schools have made in regards to
    online learning. Especially since the Covid-19 pandemic, schools were forced to partake in the virtual
    way of teaching students, and it would have been extremely challenging for schools to keep everything online
    and manage the quality of their teachings to a high standard. We chose this as our sub-topic as ww were interested
    in how different schools have manages online learning throughout the pandemic, and whether students have been
    satisfied with the quality of learning they were getting while staying virtual.
