    <h1>The different topics we researched...</h1>

    <p>Online Learning is a form of learning that takes place virtually on platforms such as Canvas and Zoom, allowing students to continue learning while being affected 
    by the pandemic, staying at home. These practices according to the Baeker 2019 book has been done even as early as 1973, with message bords that connected people together.â€‹
    The demand for online learning has been proven to be quite high, as even post-pandemic where onsite learning has been resumed, 73 percent of students still prefer courses 
    to be delivered online. A hybrid of both were also preferred by many, which equated to around 68  percent of students surveyed according to an online resource.

    <p>As shown in the homepage tab, our main focus for this research based assignment is to
    research and develop a better understanding on how online learning can affect us students
    in different ways. The main sub-categories for this which were obvious to us were the advantages
    online learning. How it can affect us positively and the different ways it can help us learn.
    We chose to research on this because it can allow us to gain a deeper understanding on what 
    online learning options are available to us currently, and how they have been benefitting us over the last
    few years especially during the covid-19 pandemic. We wanted to research on areas such as the overall
    education quality for students partaking in online learning, but also areas that are considered asgeneral quality 
    of life, such as basic commute times and transportation fees.
    </p>

    <p>We will also research on the disadvantages of online learning, which can be disadvantages directly 
    related to but not limited to the quality of learning students are able to get, the concerns<br> 
    of mental stress online learning may cause to students. This was an obvious topic regarding online
    learning that we wanted to research on as it can help us determine and identify if there has been or
    will be with the future moving forward with online learning for example. Not only has online learning 
    been practiced for many years now, it is forseen that the general practices of online learning will continue
    over the years to come, as it is seen as a cheaper alternative to a typical office setting, or an onsite campus
    learning environment. with many benefits online learning brings however, there will be many downsides as well.
    So we decided that it would be best for us to research on the risks of online learning, and what it means for students
    and workers if the virtual means of education and workplaces were to be continued in the future.
    </p>

    <p>Another topic we were also interested in was the different choices schools have made in regards to
    online learning. Especially since the Covid-19 pandemic, schools were forced to partake in the virtual
    way of teaching students, and it would have been extremely challenging for schools to keep everything online
    and manage the quality of their teachings to a high standard. We chose this as our sub-topic as ww were interested
    in how different schools have manages online learning throughout the pandemic, and whether students have been
    satisfied with the quality of learning they were getting while staying virtual. This was another part of the research
    that we found interesting as studying at AUT, we have practiced the online learning at the beginning of 2022. Although
    many of our classes resumed back to being on campus, there were still many others such as DIGD507 / Mahitahi Practices 
    and MATH503 / Mathematics for Computing which were chosen to be taught online. This meant that this was a golden opportunity
    for us to research and gain a better understanding on why some classes / papers were brought back to being on campus, and 
    why some were still being kept online, as we see this trend of the hybrid teaching schedule happening all over the world 
    as well.
