    <h1>The different topics we researched...</h1>

    <p>As shown in the homepage tab, our main focus for this research based assignment is to
    research and develop a better understanding on how online learning can affect us students
    in different ways. The main sub-categories for this which were obvious to us were the advantages
    online learning. How it can affect us positively and the different ways it can help us learn.</p>

    <p>We will also research on the disadvantages of online learning, which can be disadvantages directly 
    related to but not limited to the quality of learning students are able to get, the concerns<br> 
    of mental stress online learning may cause to students. </p>

    <p>Another topic we were also interested in was the different choices schools have made in regards to
    online learning. Especially since the Covid-19 pandemic, schools were forced to partake in the virtual
    way of teaching students, and it would have been extremely challenging for schools to keep everything online
    and manage the quality of their teachings to a high standard. We chose this as our sub-topic as ww were interested
    in how different schools have manages online learning throughout the pandemic, and whether students have been
    satisfied with the quality of learning they were getting while staying virtual.
