        Online learning, I feel has only really become an important tool to use in the most recent years because before the Covid-19 pandemic no one saw any pressing need for it so its develop of it was slowed and that is why I believe the current formats for online learning have many different flaws and I can see some of them in AUT online learning format. But I do admit that AUT is doing well developing a better format because at the beginning of the semester I found AUT format challenging to start with and get familiar with, but I have come to like it because it is very easy to navigate once for finding the path to do so. The reason I found it challenging was that I didnt have the ability to really communicate with my other classroom members besides saying it in front of the whole class, so I struggled to find a group I could ask questions to besides asking the TAs and lectures.

        I felt the beginning of the semester made it hard to gauge my process in the classes and I also felt receiving feedback was too much of a hassle for it to be worth because of the time it takes to receive it over email. I also felt going to class took much more energy even though it was just on my laptop I find in-person classes more rewarding and constructive compared to online classes.

        I do believe online learning is a necessity in this modern world and does help a lot, I just believe there needs to be a balance between in-person learning and online learning because some people excel in online and offline learning and personally, I think I need a perfect balance of both for me to excel. I do hope that online learning becomes more refined in the coming years and helps everyone to do their best to learn.

        Online learning does come with some risks, but those risks are only implemented when online learning is overused and done to offer or much students cant work all day on a computer screen. also, should not be limited in their contacted with others in their class face to face people need that social interaction. Online learning like most things good but not to the extremes so ethically I believe online should work hand and hand within person learning. Online learning also does contribute to society and human well-being by needing educated people that might live to far from any type of schooling that they can sustain in the long run. It bring education to some the hardest places to react and at a high level.
