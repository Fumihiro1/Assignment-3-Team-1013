<p>The topic we chose to investigate in our extensive research is Online Learning. Online learning is a form 
  <br>
  of virtual study where students are taught via online sources such as Canvas and Zoom. One of the
  <br>
  main reasons why Online Learning has been a global interest for a few years now is due to the global
  <br>
  pandemic which started occuring during the first few months of 2020, known as Covid-19. This 
  <br>
  effectively put many students and teachers into a lockdown state, where only bare essentials were 
  <br>
  able to be open like a supermarket or a pharmacy, to stop the spread of the virus. This meant that students 
  <br>
  needed a new form of education to partake in during the various lockdowns the globe has encountered, 
  <br>
  which raised the attention to Online / Virtual Learning. The reason why we found this topic to be
  <br>
  interesting to us is because we have been taking part in online learning ourselves, at AUT. 
  <br>
  Most classes at the start of 2022 at AUT were online, with the exception of some being changed  
  <br>
  to being held on campus after the Pandemic started dying down. We thought that this extensive
  <br>
  research opportunity for an assignment was great to find out the different effects of online learning
  <br> 
  has on students, as being students this research could help us gain a deeper understanding of what
  <br>
  online learning can do to us, but also the future moving forward with online learning.
